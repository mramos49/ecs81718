          Hello and welcome to my website. This website will be a little about me, and the games that 
          I most enjoy playing, and my opinion about them. I will be talking about the following games. Fornite,
          GTA V, and Rainbow Six siege. These are my three favorite games.
       </p> </div>
      
      <div> <p>
           Now a little bit about me. Before, when I was 10, I thought that gaming was a big waste of time. 
           It was most likely because thats what parents thought about it, so I did too. It wasn't until I started 
           watching GTA V video from youtubers like Vanoss, among others. I fell inlove with this game, and after 
           a few months, my dad bought me a PS4 for Christmas. I got GTA V and Black Ops III, but I really mostly 
           played GTA. Looking back on it now, it was really bad. I would come home from school, quickly eat something,
           do my homework, and then play for the rest of the day. When I didn't have school, I would play all day. Then 
           my friend bought Rainbow Six Siege, and we gameshared it, and I started to play that too. I never really got 
           that good, mostly because I can't aim with a controller, I much rather prefer keyboard and mouse. Recently I 
           into Fornite. I bought the season 3 battle pass, so I am trying to play as much as I can. 
       </p> </div>
        
        <div> <p>
           Nowadays, I don't play as much as I did before, but I try to get in some game time everyday. When I no lifed GTA,
           I was still in Middleschool, in 7th and 8th grade, and I found my classes to be easy, so I had more time. I am 
           now in my Freshman year of Highschool, and I now find my classes harder. I spend more time on homework now. When 
           I barely started, in first quarter, I got some bad grades, compared to what I had gotten before. I started to
           controll my self, and I applied myself more. Another thing that has left me with less time, is me getting more
           involved in my Church, I am Catholic by the way. On Thursday I have to go for youth group, which I am one of the 
           leaders of, so that takes away from Thursday night. On friday, I have Confirmation class, so that takes away my Friday.
           On saturday I basically go the whole day, in the morning I go to help the Secretary, who is also my teacher, and now
           a good friend. We usually finish at like 3 o'clock. She drops me off and I usually get some homework done, before going 
           back for mass. If I finished my homework on Saturday, I have Sunday to play games all day.
