        Fortnite and I have a love hate relationship. Sometimes I love this game, sometimes I really hate it.
        This was thankfully fixed, but when it was in the game, it was gamebreaking. Double pump. This was the
        most broken thing in the game. Me and my friends died so many times to a team full of double pumpers. I 
        never really learned to use it, because I hated it, and using it on a controller is a lot harder. However, 
        there are moments in this games where you just love it. Having a sniper shot hit someone at a long distance,
        rocket riding, and so much more.
       </p> </div>
      
      <div> <p>
        The biggest argument for this game is, what is better Fortnite or PUBG. I personally think that they're
        both really good games. I like the realism of PUBG, and how you really have to be skilled with a gun to get
        a kill. However, I love the fact that Fortnite is free, and you don't have to pay in order to play, but you 
        can buy the battle pass, and get some more cosmetic items, and that only cost a optional $10, instead of
        $30 in order to even play PUBG.
        
        The one that really gets me mad about the Fortnite vs. PUBG, is that for reason people think that Fortnite
        is just a rip off of PUBG, and that PUBG was the original creator of Battle Royals, when in fact, Rust and 
        H1Z1 had their own versions of battle royal way before PUBG. They also don't know that PUBG runs on the engine
        that Epic Games made for Fornite's BR. 
       </p> </div>
        
        <div> <p>
           I wouldn't say that I am that good of a Fornite player. I only have 4 wins total. Yeah, I told you I wasn't 
           the best. I started later than most, I started to play a lot of during the later half of Season 2. Now I bought
           the Season 3 pass, and at the time of writing this, I am at tier 35. I would say I am a lot better than I was.
           I still need to work on building right now, but oh my god was I was bad before. I remember the first time I played, 
           and I was playing with my friend who wasn't that good either, but better than me. I remember having to drop and not
           knowing how to. I remember him telling me to build around him and revive and having no idea how to do either of those
           things. I feel like me, and the rest of the players who use controllers, are at a big disadvantage against people who 
           play on keyboard. Keyboard and mouse give you more precise aim, and you have hot keys in order to switch weapons fasters.
           I am considering to buy a keyboard and mouse just for that game, but I dont have anywhere to put it, where I play, I probably
           wont yet.
