                    Im going to be completely honest, I did not play the full story mode of GTA V cause I prefered to play GTA
                    online with my friend. I did try to play the story mode when the online servers were down, but I stopped 
                    because I got bored and the servers were back up. For what I played, I didn't find it that interesting to play,
                    I did find the 3 playable characters, Michael, Franklin and Trevor to be very interesting, but I just really 
                    prefered online more than the story mode.
                </p>

                    I use to love GTA V Online, I would play all day, almost everyday when possible. I was so 
                    much to just mess around and try to level up to unlock new things. I got the game around the same time
                    as one of my other friends and we were just in constant competition with eatherother, who was better
                    who had the better car, who had more money, just who ever was better in every aspect. We played around
                    the same time, but I was always better, even if he said otherwise. It was fun to play when I got, and I
                    got it in late 2015, so GTA was actually still fun back then.

                    In my personal opinion GTA Online has died. I can no longer find it fun. You have to spend too much time playing
                    in order to be able to afford the new things that they put in DLC. The vehicles are expensive, and the pay outs
                    arent good. The only way to get money without actually having to play for long hours, is buying sharkcards, but 
                    even that isn't worth it. You can now only buy about 2 new cars, with a $100 real world money, when before you 
                    could buy like 8 or 9 cars with that money. In order to get players back like myself, rockstar needs a DLC with 
                    good and easy payouts, or atleast, lower the price of the new vehicles. In my opinion rockstar has killed their
                    own game, by being greedy with their money, and trying to milk GTA online. I really hope rockstar does not do this
                    when GTA VI comes out, and don't ruin the online feature with microtransactions.
